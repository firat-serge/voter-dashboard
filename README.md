The figure above represents the processess involved which included:
* Creating a database in a suitable format by downloading the data online and processing it using python 
* The coding process itself which was predominatly done using python and some R
* Extraction and visualization of the  data and given its geodata, the necessity of representation of some form of maps.
* The establishment of the dashboard itself which had to display information in various formats.
Various packages and extension are necessary to create the environment to enable us go from the database to the display of the dashboard. The packages necessary and database viewing are:
<br>`conda install --file requirements.txt --channel conda-forge`
<br>`View: sa.votes_geojson`
